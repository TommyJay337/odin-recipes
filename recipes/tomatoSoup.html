    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This creamy tomato soup is delicious and has a twist - the addition of strong, black coffee. This is the perfect summer dish for using freshly picked tomatoes from the garden. Remember - the better the quality of the tomatoes, the better the taste of the soup.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups chopped tomato</li>
        <li>8oz tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1/3 cup cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a stock pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and parsley; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato sauce, coffee, water, sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring the soup to a boil and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour the hot soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Stir in the cream and heat until warm. Do not boil.</li>
    </ol>
